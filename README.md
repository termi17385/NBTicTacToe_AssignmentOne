# Nine Board Tic Tac Toe

## Introduction
Nine Board Tic Tac Toe is a console-based game project that puts a unique twist on the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. This project is part of my student assignment and serves as a demonstration of my skills in C++ programming.

## Features

- Nine separate Tic Tac Toe boards arranged in a 3x3 grid.
- Engaging gameplay that combines strategy and quick thinking.
- I have implemented three types of players: Smart Player, Random Player, and Human Player.
- I have provided options to play as either "X" or "O" or both.
- In single-player mode, you can challenge yourself against AI opponents.
- An "algorithm" :) has been implemented to determine the overall game winner across multiple boards.

## Getting Started

To start playing Nine Board Tic Tac Toe, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment.
3. Compile and run the game.
4. Enjoy playing and testing your strategic skills!

## Usage

- Choose your player type (Smart Player, Random Player, or Human Player) for both "X" and "O" players.
- Strategize to win individual Tic Tac Toe boards within the 3x3 grid.
- The game will automatically determine the overall winner based on the rules of Tic Tac Toe.
- In single-player mode, challenge yourself against AI opponents.
- Customize your gaming experience by choosing your preferred players and symbols.
